      <h3 class="">Biography</h3>
      <p>Born in Edinburgh, Hancock spent his formative years in India, where his father worked as a surgeon. Having returned to the UK, he graduated from Durham University in 1973, receiving a First Class Honours degree in sociology. As a journalist, Hancock worked for many British papers, such as The Times, The Sunday Times, The Independent, and The Guardian. He co-edited New Internationalist magazine from 1976 to 1979, and served as the East Africa correspondent of The Economist from 1981 to 1983.</p>

      <h3 class="">My View</h3>
      <p>Graham changed my life. He opened up my interest for history once again. Magicians of the Gods is phenomenal, and you will get a sense that Graham uncovers some universal truths for you as you navigate through the book.</p>
      <p>Moreover, his fight for consciousness is wonderful. From ayahuasca to marijuana, he understands that the legalization of drugs is about freedom. Let individuals experiement, choose, and grow by themselves!</p>
